# TODOs for the Bloch Sphere builder

## Preparation
### Brainstorm Ideas
- Bloch Sphere, no quantum circuit
- IBM / BlockSphereSim as inspiration
- scope: take input (vector or modifications) and visualize
- only front end 
- animation of rotation VS jump into place (toggle-able)
- visualization
- build as library/component to be modular

### Tools
- [ ] research React Three Fiber
- [ ] read nextjs docs

## Implementation
- [ ] set up NextJS 
- [ ] choosing input type e.g. JSON, normal object
- [ ] choosing animation tool
- [ ] setting up JS base
- [ ] NextJS tutorial
